# phone-numbers-interview

* The goal would be to implement features in PhoneNumber class so that tests pass.

* You are not expected to finish this test, no one has. This is about seeing how you approach and solve the challenge.
* You can use anything you'd normally use during this exercise (e.g. google, ask questions, the IDE...etc).
* We want to know your thoughts so the more you talk us through what you are doing and thinking, the better.
* Modify whatever needed â€“ no code is sacred.
* Please feel free to ask questions. I may or may not be able to answer them.
